            Renamed 'makeCsrfCookie' to 'makeXsrfCookie' and marked the former as deprecated.

      - description: 'acceptLogin' and 'makeCsrfCookie' functions
        notes: >
            'makeCsrfCookie' for CSRF cookies.
            Renamed 'makeCookie' to 'makeSessionCookie' to avoid confusion
            ('makeCookie' is now an alias for 'makeSessionCookie' and is marked as
            deprecated).
            'acceptLogin' sets both the token and CSRF cookies.
